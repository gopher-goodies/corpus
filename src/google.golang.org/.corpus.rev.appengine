    internal: listen on localhost for dev_appserver; avoid macOS Firewall (#45)
    
    Without this, the macOS firewall asks if _ah_exe should accept
    incoming network connections, since by default it listens on all
    interfaces. For development purposes, it is sufficient to only listen
    on localhost.
